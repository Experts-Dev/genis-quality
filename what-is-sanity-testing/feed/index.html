		<description><![CDATA[There are times when I wonder if we in the testing profession sometimes invent a new term (here, sanity testing) just for the sake of it. Not because it is necessary.

In over twenty years as a test manager, I have become a staunch supporter of a strong release management process where smoke testing and regression testing are key components. If my clients do not see a need for microscopic refinement of an already well-defined area of testing  then neither do I.

Indeed, one might be forgiven for wondering if this is just an excuse for large consultancies to spend lots of extra time reorganising existing test activity to justify charging their clients more.

Since the perceived difference between smoke testing and sanity testing is so tiny, maybe the more interesting question is which one of these terms you would choose to describe the same base.
