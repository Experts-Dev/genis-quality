Sometimes, we create a wiki and add all observations ( to save time from creating elaborate bug report) that we find and later with product manager, Dev &#038; QE manager and the team will decide if it has to be fixed or not. if the decision is to fix, then we create a ticket for it. if not add comments to the Wiki and leave it.

Sometimes, we create a ticket and log defect for all the issues found.]]></description>
