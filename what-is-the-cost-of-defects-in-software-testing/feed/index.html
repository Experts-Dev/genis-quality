		<description><![CDATA[The cost of fixing the Defects totally depends upon when the defect is found, if the defect is found in the requirements or design phase, then it is relatively easy to fix and less cost effective and if the defect is found out while acceptance testing or when the software is live, then the cost will be relatively high because the Defects have to be fixed and re tested before it can be deployed live again]]></description>
