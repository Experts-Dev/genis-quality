<li>Testers are supposed to prepare different artifacts like <a href="../what-is-the-purpose-and-importance-of-test-plans/index.html">Test plan</a>, <a href="../what-are-the-test-approaches-or-strategies-in-software-testing/index.html">Test strategy</a>, <a href="../test-case/index.html">Test cases</a>, Test data, Test results etc. and to effectively prepare them, written communication skills should be good.</li>
<li>As a tester, you are expected to send daily status report about what you did, which <a href="../what-is-defect-or-bugs-or-faults-in-software-testing/index.html">bugs or defects</a> you found and what is the plan of work next day. For this, understanding of point-to-point communication, what to include and what not, is very important.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Curiosity</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Being in software testing means asking lots of questions.</li>
<li>Testers have to deal with bad or incomplete requirements. And when requirements are not enough to clarify things, testers have to ask meaningful questions.</li>
<li>Testers should be curious about things like why, what, when and How. More questions yield more information and that helps testers to perform testing effectively.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Grasping abilities</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Testing almost always gets the least time. In less time, testers are expected to perform effective testing. Understanding the requirements in short time is therefore very important.</li>
<li>To grasp the purpose of software, how it will be used, what all changes have been applied etc. is necessary.</li>
<li>Sharp grasping abilities make the task easier and efficient.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Some definitions and terms of software testing is important to know, before entering into software testing field.</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to work as a software tester should have knowledge of software testing concepts and processes given below</li>
<li><a href="../what-is-a-defect-life-cycle/index.html">Bug life cycle</a></li>
<li>different types of testing like <a href="../what-is-regression-testing-in-software/index.html">regression testing</a>, <a href="../what-is-integration-testing/index.html">integration testing</a>, <a href="../what-is-functional-testing-testing-of-functions-in-software/index.html">functional testing</a>, <a href="../what-is-performance-testing-in-software/index.html">performance testing</a> etc, when each type of testing is being performed,</li>
<li>terms like test plans, test strategies, <a href="../what-are-the-estimation-techniques-in-software-testing/index.html">test estimates</a> and their importance are some basic factors</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Basic knowledge about computer<br/>
</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge of below mentioned basics about computer is helpful because as a tester you are going to work with it, everyday.</li>
<li>Any computer operating system (Windows or Linux)</li>
<li>Different Browsers (IE, FF, Safari, Opera) etc.</li>
<li>Any mobile operating system (Android/iOS/Windows)</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>User’s perspective</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>As a tester, you need to understand following points about end user’s perspective because it helps in defining more real-time test scenarios.</li>
<li>Who is going to use the product</li>
<li>What purpose the product will resolve</li>
<li>How the customer might handle the product</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Testing of products / applications is equally important as development of products / applications and therefore proper understanding of testing concepts is very useful for any Junior tester.</p>
<h3>Roles and responsibilities of a Junior Tester</h3>
<p><strong>Reports to :</strong> Mostly, Test Lead (depends on organization structure)</p>
<p><strong>Role and Responsibilities<br/>
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Requirement Analysis </strong></li>
<p>As a tester, analysis of requirements provided by customer is the main point to start with.</p>
<p/>
The tester is supposed to understand the requirements and relevant domain of work, prepare query list and share it with Test lead.
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Test Effort Estimation </strong></li>
<p>While test planning meeting, the tester is supposed to understand the details of tasks to be performed.</p>
<p/>
Also, he/she is supposed to come up with estimated efforts required to complete the task efficiently.
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Test cases documentation<br/>
</strong></li>
<p>Based on task defined and modules assigned, tester is expected to document test cases for the same.</p>
<p/>
Based on organization and development method, test cases or test scenarios are prepared in specific format.
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Reporting and tracking Defect<br/>
</strong></li>
<p>Reporting bug, observed while executing testing task is important. Again, each organization uses different tools/templates to report and track defect.</p>
<p/>
Tester needs to understand how specific tool works and is supposed to report detailed defect report.</p>
<p/>
Tester is also supposed to track the reported defect and according to its criticality, needs to make sure that defect gets resolved.
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Listing improvement areas</strong></li>
<p>A junior tester is a fresh eye to the product and therefore expectation from him/her is to come up with suggestions to improve the product in terms of <a href="../what-is-usability-testing-in-software-and-its-benifits-to-end-user/index.html">usability</a>.
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Reporting to Test Lead / QA Lead</strong></li>
<p>The tester is supposed to send daily status report to test lead, describing testing activities performed and relevant status.</p>
<p/>
Daily status report is a tool for junior tester to communicate with Test lead about the work done.</p>
<p/>
Crisp and concise status report is an art, every junior tester should learn. The report, which does not explain story of 1000 words but in few words, gives the whole idea about what went right and what did not.
</ol>
<h3>How to be a good tester</h3>
<p>After joining software testing field, to grow, one has to work hard. But with hard work, there are some points to be taken care to <a href="../software-tester/index.html">become a good tester</a>.  Let’s have a look at them :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand priorities :</strong> As a tester, you are given multiple tasks with pre-defined timeline. If priority of each task is understood, as a tester, you will not mess up things or will not stress out.
<p/>Based on experience, you should be able to prioritize things like</li>
<ul>
<li>What should be tested first and what can be given less priority</li>
<li>Which test cases to be automated and which should be executed manually</li>
<li>Which bug fix should be verified on critical basis and which one can be delayed for some time.</li>
<p>In case of candidates who have no prior experience in software testing, the above prioritization will be done by a senior team member, to begin with.
</ul>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Quality Vs Quantity :</strong> As a junior tester, you are inclined to report more number of bugs. But rather than quantity of bugs, you should focus on quality of bugs.</li>
<p/>
Identifying more critical bugs and reporting them with complete details is more important than identifying and reporting 100 user interface issues.</p>
<p/>
Of course, every bug is important but at the initial stage of testing, if critical bugs are identified, they cost less in terms of repair.
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Testing ideas :</strong> As a tester, you are supposed to understand how the product will be used by end user. Based on that, generate number of ideas to test the product differently, to cover every aspect of the product.</li>
<p/>
The more testing ideas (test scenarios) you generate and implement more <a href="../what-is-test-coverage-in-software-testing-its-advantages-and-disadvantages/index.html">test coverage</a> you will get and that means less risk of missed bug.
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Effective bug reporting :</strong> As much as it is important to identify bug, equally important is to report the bug effectively.</li>
<p/>All the needed information like Steps to reproduce, details of test environment, test data used, relevant screenshots and video, build version etc. helps in fixing bug faster.
</ol>
