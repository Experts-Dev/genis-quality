		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a tricky question, that SIT should perform after Unit testing or System Testing. You need to understand the definition of Unit and System first.
If we are taking about testing a product which is integrating 5 different systems, then the individual systems which are already tested individually and operational, will be considered as individual units for this new Product, so considering this, First Unit testing is done (testing individual systems), after that System Integration Testing performed and at last the System Testing (product testing as whole) will be done. Hope you get the point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The text states that &quot;...may be done after system testing.&quot;, i think it depends your methodology and/or project. You can used stubs and drivers (if you do not have access to the other system) to simulate SIT after unit testing. But from my opinion we need first to assure that are code/system is good before interfacing it with other systems.
Example: testing an app, and this app will interface with other system. Note: i have access to the system that i will be interfacing with.
1.-Unit testing
2.-Integration Testing
2.1- Stub and drivers; with system that i will be interfacing
3.-SIT (sending / receiving data from other system)
4-System Testing
5.-AUT]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[example - The starting point is you need to be clear what you define is a system. In this example I defined a system as a complete deployed product/application. SIT is often used in big organization were multiple products are connected together and testing is a workflow between these . Take for example a commercial bank. They may have a mainframe system, an online banking system a credit card processing system and so on. They need to test that all these systems can work together - An example test case may say they want to release a new feature that brand new users that register for the latest credit card will get no fees on their online banking. This workflow will require all systems to respond in an integrated way. The endpoints to the test case start at the new user registration and flow through. Hope this helps.]]></description>
