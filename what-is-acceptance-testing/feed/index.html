		<description><![CDATA[Hi All,

Is there any defect leakage defined as per ISTQB standards ? OR (What is the acceptable  defect leakage limit from system test to UAT testing.)

for ex. 5%of system test defects ??

Thanks in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, greate site! 

It would be great, if the relations between Alpha, Beta and Acceptance testing is covered. 

Acceptance Testing seems to involve the actual users, whereas Alpha Testing does not (it&#039;s normally done by developers and a QA staff, following this site here: http://tryqa.com/what-is-alpha-testing/ ). Therefore Alpha Testing cannot be simply part of Acceptance Testing. 
But Beta Testing involves the users, but it&#039;s not clear if it&#039;s Acceptance Testing or if it&#039;s a larger scale testing which is only done after a first phase of user testing as part of Acceptance Testing.

Also, if this is true:
&quot;Originally, the term alpha testing meant the first phase of testing in a software development process. The first phase includes unit testing, component testing, and system testing. Beta testing can be considered “pre-release testing.&quot; (http://tryqa.com/what-is-beta-testing/)
Then is there a place for Acceptance testing in the Alpha-Beta-distinction?

Thank you very much!
