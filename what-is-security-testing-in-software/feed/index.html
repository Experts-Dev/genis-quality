Some sources, e.g. ISTQB, claim that security testig is a functional one. This would be compliant with ISO 9126 (which the ISTQB is based on) but it goes against most other sources - as far as I know, security is a non functional requirement. In ISO 25010, security is one of the quality characteristics (non functional).

I believe security testing is non functional testing as we do not test functionality, we examine the system from this perspective the same way we test performance.

ISO 25010 is an updated revision of ISO 9126. Security is considered non-functional.
