		<description><![CDATA[Really informative blog. 
Because no matter how good you are, you can&#039;t think of everything.

You will also be asked to make your software do things that you never intended for it to do.
You will also never have requirements that are so clear that you will be able to think of every possibility to make sure the code doesn&#039;t break.
You will also work with other people&#039;s software and apis that will not always work as intended, but you will assume that it does, or should, leading to a defects in your &quot;perfect&quot; case.

So Testing/ Quality assurance plays an important role in Software performance and success. ]]></description>
