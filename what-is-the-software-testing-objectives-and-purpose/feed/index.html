		<description><![CDATA[The first objective is to find defects but preventing defects is an objective as well, as per ISTQB:

A main focus of reviews and other static tests is to carry out testing as early as possible, finding and fixing defects more cheaply and preventing defects from appearing at later stages of this project. 

These activities help us find out about defects earlier and identify potential clusters. 

Additionally, an important outcome of all testing is information that assists in risk assessment; these reviews will contribute to the planning for the tests executed later in the software development life cycle. 

We might also carry out root cause analysis to prevent defects and failures happening again and perhaps to identify the cause of clusters and potential future clusters.]]></description>
