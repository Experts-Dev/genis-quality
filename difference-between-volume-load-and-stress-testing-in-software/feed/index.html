		<description><![CDATA[I suppose that is Stress testing. There is a very thin line between volume and stress testing.

The only difference I can find between the both type of testing is:

Stress Testing: When the load placed on the system is raised or accelerated beyond the normal range then it is known as Stress Testing.

Volume Testing:  The process of checking the system, whether the system can handle the required amounts of data, user requests, etc. is known as Volume Testing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, large amounts of data are both Load and Volume testing. The difference is this:

Load testing it testing up to the loads specified in the NFR&#039;s, to ensure the system will cope with scheduled and planed loads.

Volume testing is testing above and beyond the stated requirements (but not to stress levels), to see when the system will creak and groan to give the client a feel for when they need to further invest for the future.]]></description>
