You must note that project lead are required lots of skills(development/design/project management/requirement side/marketing). Some companies they require them to be able to develop and design or at least have the capability to trouble shoot mess up caused by dev and pick up architectural mess-ups before it is too late.

Project lead (web director/PM) are  converting spageti requirements to something that is doable. They try managing the scope that is normally messed up by the Sales who really do the max not to apologize to the customer even though they promise everything. In addition if project lead do not have choice of developer or do not know the skill set of the developer the project normally burns.
It burns if the Producer decided the budget limit too. Thus theses are reasons why it is so difficult as a project lead.]]></description>
