		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Even late changes in requirements are welcomed&quot; - Not in my world - the development model aside, significant requirement changes can disrupt development and cause code to be thrown out, which equals sunk-money. We also found that the frequent delivery model was disruptive, especially on the UI side since the user never knew when the UI would change can cause a learning curve.

We also repeatedly find that carving work out into two-week (or any number) of sprints is less than optimal and we frequently had free time at the end of a sprint because there was not enough in the story for a full two weeks - 10 day sprints with stories that take 7 days. Also, running into a development snag (happens a lot in the real world) can delay a story till the next sprint and delay the deployment of the other stories that rely on the delayed story. Now that part of the system is late and out of sync with the rest, but development continues and the developer who know only how to merge into master now have to contend with branches and don&#039;t really understand that process.

The uses of Agile I&#039;ve seen do not increase interactions between developers and business people, in fact, we never knew who the business people were.

All Agile really does is provide more metrics for the development manager to cite in reports.]]></description>
