		<description><![CDATA[If by matric, you mean that she is studying in 10th grade, then it may be too early for her to take the ISTQB exam. 

Most organizations look for 15 to 16 years of education when hiring a candidate. However, there are always exceptions. Some startup or small businesses may be willing to hire someone with 10 years of education if they see potential but this is rare. She would need at least 15 to 16 years of education if she wants to have a good career and opportunity to work in large organizations.

Just taking the ISTQB exam will not help get you a job. However, it does give you an additional advantage over other candidates. 

If there are 50 candidates who apply for an entry level job, its easier to filter them by choosing to interview only those who have an ISTQB certification since they have shown a good understanding of the subject.]]></description>
